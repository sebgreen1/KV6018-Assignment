# KV6018-Assignment
This repository contains a Genetic Algorithm solution to the 
KV6018 cargo container loading problem, as well as two alternative 
methods to offer comparison, and visualisation of results.

## Contents
- main.py – Genetic Algorithm solver
- reference_instances.py – Reference problem instances
- alternative_solvers.py - Greedy heuristic and random-restart implementation
- visualisation.py - Visualisation code for each instance solution 

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `python main.py`

The solver generates perfect (fitness = 0) solutions for all
provided reference instances.

3. Run 'python alternative_solvers.py' for comparison to other algorithms
